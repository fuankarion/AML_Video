### Homework
1. Choose two of the strategies presented, explain how they work.
1. Explain why you consider that these strategies would improve the performance of the baseline TSN (do not confuse TSN -code provided here- with TSM -final paper presented-).
1. Implement the strategies you chose and discuss your results

Tip: It is probably easier to implement and analyse each strategy independently. 

**Bonus:** Implement both the non-local block or the TSM module in the forward function and discuss your results

### Running TSN Demo
Make sure you fix the path to the dataset train and val direcories, then run 

```
python TSN.py
```
